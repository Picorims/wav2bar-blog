Wav2Bar Beta 0.2.0","date":"2021-07-21T16:01:35.000Z","updated":"2021-07-21T16:28:11.000Z","thumbnail":"2021-07-21-155400-wav2bar-0-2-0-beta.png","_content":"\n\nHi!\n\nWav2Bar 0.2.0 has just been released with multiple improvements to try out. Here is a quick tour over the major changes of this version. For detailed changelogs, see the [Github Releases page](https://github.com/Picorims/wav2bar/releases/tag/v0.2.0 \"Wav2Bar 0.2.0 changelogs\").\n\n## SVG Filters support\n\nSVG filters are now supported on all objects, which allows you to interact with the graphical output in many ways. ***This feature is useful if you want to add visual effects to an object: blur, glow, image correction, distortion, extrusion, outline, shadows, lighting, etc.*** For instance, the outlined visualizer of the thumbnail and the image blurring on the thumbnail have both been made with SVG filters!\n\nSVG filters are added by pasting them in a dedicated field. A filter is defined within a `<filter></filter>` tag, all separated by `[#]`. So multiple filters are added by entering `<filter></filter>[#]<filter></filter>[#]...`. Within a filter tag, you define the filter by following the SVG specification. Now, everyone is not an expert in SVG, and the syntax can be intimidating. Hopefully, there are many resources on the Internet to help you out crafting them:\n\n- [SVG Filter Builder](https://svgfilters.com/): A graphical user interface for making SVG filters. Paste the result between `<filter></filter>` to make it work with Wav2Bar. Alternatively, you can use other tools like Inkscape to make them.\n- [A compilation of useful resources to learn SVG filters](https://speckyboy.com/svg-filter-tutorials/ \"The 10 Best SVG Filter Resources & Tutorials\"): It also showcase what you can do with SVG filters.\n- [maketext.io](https://maketext.io/): Doesn't work out of the box, but great for inspiration.\n- [RIP Tutorial](https://riptutorial.com/svg/topic/3262/filters): Another tutorial with examples.\n\nThis is definitely not a feature for everyone, but if you want to push Wav2Bar into its limits, that's a good way to do it.\n\n### Simple example\n\nLets take the following filter:\n```svg\n<filter>\n    <feGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\"5.5\" result=\"coloredBlur\"/>\n    <feMerge>\n        <feMergeNode in=\"coloredBlur\"/>\n        <feMergeNode in=\"SourceGraphic\"/>\n    </feMerge> \n</filter>\n```\nThis filter produces a glow effect, by blurring the source, and drawing it behind. Here is the end result:\n\n{% asset_img 2021-07-21-162137-beta-0-2-glow-example.png Glow effect on a visualizer with SVG filters %}\n\n## User interface improvements\n\nThis update also includes improvements for the user interface, mainly for object interaction.\n\n{% asset_img 2021-07-21-wav2bar-0-2-beta-before-after.png Glow effect on a visualizer with SVG filters %}\n\nThe user interface is globally more compact to display more options on screen, without having to scroll too much. Everything is also more aligned to improve readability. In some cases, when an invalid value is entered by the user, it will show in red, meaning the value has been ignored as it is not valid. Right now it is only effective on number fields, however it may be extended to text fields in the future.\n\nSome new features have been introduced as well. ***Some shortcut buttons have been added to easily resize and position objects. A color picker has also been added.*** It only initialize with hex values, but support multiple formats (except alpha). You can still tweak the colors with the string field if you need to.\n\n{% asset_img 2021-07-21-w2b-0-2-beta-color-picker.png Glow effect on a visualizer with SVG filters %}\n\nSome small tweaks have also been made here and there.\n\n## Experimental export mode\n\nWhen Wav2Bar exports a video, it first generates all frames as images, and then combine them into a video. Right now, the PNG format is used, and video exporting is painfully slow.\n\nAs an experimentation, you can now choose to use JPEG images with 100% quality instead. ***While it shouldn't impact the video quality, it should however make the export generally two times faster, and sometimes up to six times faster!***. The difference in speed is visually noticeable when looking at the progress.\n\nKeeping the export window behind the main window can also improve exporting speed and performance.\n\n## Bug fixes\n\nMultiple bugs have been patched in this release.

Here is a quick tour over the major changes of this version. For detailed changelogs, see the [Github Releases page](https://github.com/Picorims/wav2bar/releases/tag/v0.2.0 \"Wav2Bar 0.2.0 changelogs\").\n\n## SVG Filters support\n\nSVG filters are now supported on all objects, which allows you to interact with the graphical output in many ways. ***This feature is useful if you want to add visual effects to an object: blur, glow, image correction, distortion, extrusion, outline, shadows, lighting, etc.*** For instance, the outlined visualizer of the thumbnail and the image blurring on the thumbnail have both been made with SVG filters!\n\nSVG filters are added by pasting them in a dedicated field. A filter is defined within a `<filter></filter>` tag, all separated by `[#]`. So multiple filters are added by entering `<filter></filter>[#]<filter></filter>[#]...`. Within a filter tag, you define the filter by following the SVG specification. Now, everyone is not an expert in SVG, and the syntax can be intimidating. Hopefully, there are many resources on the Internet to help you out crafting them:\n\n- [SVG Filter Builder](https://svgfilters.com/): A graphical user interface for making SVG filters. Paste the result between `<filter></filter>` to make it work with Wav2Bar. Alternatively, you can use other tools like Inkscape to make them.\n- [A compilation of useful resources to learn SVG filters](https://speckyboy.com/svg-filter-tutorials/ \"The 10 Best SVG Filter Resources & Tutorials\"): It also showcase what you can do with SVG filters.\n- [maketext.io](https://maketext.io/): Doesn't work out of the box, but great for inspiration.\n- [RIP Tutorial](https://riptutorial.com/svg/topic/3262/filters): Another tutorial with examples.\n\nThis is definitely not a feature for everyone, but if you want to push Wav2Bar into its limits, that's a good way to do it.\n\n### Simple example\n\nLets take the following filter:\n```svg\n<filter>\n    <feGaussianBlur stdDeviation=\"5.5\" result=\"coloredBlur\"/>\n    <feMerge>\n        <feMergeNode in=\"coloredBlur\"/>\n        <feMergeNode in=\"SourceGraphic\"/>\n    </feMerge> \n</filter>\n```\nThis filter produces a glow effect, by blurring the source, and drawing it behind. Here is the end result:\n\n{% asset_img 2021-07-21-162137-beta-0-2-glow-example.png Glow effect on a visualizer with SVG filters %}\n\n## User interface improvements\n\nThis update also includes improvements for the user interface, mainly for object interaction.\n\n{% asset_img 2021-07-21-wav2bar-0-2-beta-before-after.png Glow effect on a visualizer with SVG filters %}\n\nThe user interface is globally more compact to display more options on screen, without having to scroll too much. Everything is also more aligned to improve readability. In some cases, when an invalid value is entered by the user, it will show in red, meaning the value has been ignored as it is not valid. Right now it is only effective on number fields, however it may be extended to text fields in the future.\n\nSome new features have been introduced as well. ***Some shortcut buttons have been added to easily resize and position objects. A color picker has also been added.*** It only initialize with hex values, but support multiple formats (except alpha). You can still tweak the colors with the string field if you need to.\n\n{% asset_img 2021-07-21-w2b-0-2-beta-color-picker.png Glow effect on a visualizer with SVG filters %}\n\nSome small tweaks have also been made here and there.\n\n## Experimental export mode\n\nWhen Wav2Bar exports a video, it first generates all frames as images, and then combine them into a video. Right now, the PNG format is used, and video exporting is painfully slow.\n\nAs an experimentation, you can now choose to use JPEG images with 100% quality instead. ***While it shouldn't impact the video quality, it should however make the export generally two times faster, and sometimes up to six times faster!***. The difference in speed is visually noticeable when looking at the progress.\n\nKeeping the export window behind the main window can also improve exporting speed and performance.\n\n## Bug fixes\n\nMultiple bugs have been patched in this release. The most noticeable are listed below:\n- Changing the points count of a visualizer no longer breaks its display.\n- Text overline was not showing properly.\n- Updated the font size help bubble, that was outdated.\n- Removed \"audio not saved\" from the saving option title, this was only accurate in pre 0.1.0-beta releases. ***(Audio has always been saved in public releases!)***\n\n## What's next ?\n\nI will probably make a 0.2.x update adding CLI support for some basic tasks.

In this post I will talk about the first impressions I have on this very first release, and give you an update on what you can expect in the future.\n\n## Wav2Bar 0.1 is out\n\nFirst things first, Wav2Bar 0.1 has been released in April 2021. This first beta includes everything that was originally intended to be in the final version (minus great UI). Allongside the package release, I also made a small showcase video about the current possibilities of the software (which you can watch [here](https://youtu.be/NWCe2zKY8Wo \"Wav2bar Showcase video\") if you haven't).\n\nIn this first beta, you will probably notice the user interface could really use some improvements, and that's normal. I firstly focused on having something that works, before diving too much in the UI (before working well, it has to work!). It will be improved throughout the next betas gradually. You probably also noticed that the video export can be very slow. I am aware of this problem, and while I have some ideas to try reducing it a tiny bit, it probably will stay like that for a while if not forever.\n\n## Answer to some feedback I received\n\nI didn't expect much feedback on the first release, especially as it has not been widely shared (a few social media posts and some shared links on Discord). A lot of commercial tools, online generators from templates and tutorials for these exists on the Internet, which makes it very difficult to be viewed anyway.\n\nFirstly I would like to give many thanks to the few people that tried it and provided direct feedback as well as some kind words about the project. It is very fullfilling to know it is helpful to some people! I also want to thanks those who stared the project on GitHub, that's not something I expected and it's also very motivating to see people interested in the project.\n\nNow, I also got some suggestions that I would like to share and talk about. Someone on GitHub suggested a Linux CLI for the tool. While this is just a too big task to handle for a solo driven project, I like the idea to be able to launch an export from the command line given a created project. That's not something I would implement anytime soon, but I put it in my todo list as a suggestion for a future update.\n\nSomeone by mail also suggested 2 things more graphical related. Firstly, he mentionned that the preview and the actual video could sometimes have differences in terms of rendering.

I will also remove FFmpeg from the repository (It was not tracked anymore since a while back but still exists on the remote master branch, but there is absolutely no reason for it not to go away). Basically, I will just get rid of Git LFS from the entire project. However, I have to make sure to do it right, and try not to mess up the repository when doing so.

In this post I will talk about the first impressions I have on this very first release, and give you an update on what you can expect in the future.\n\n## Wav2Bar 0.1 is out\n\nFirst things first, Wav2Bar 0.1 has been released in April 2021. This first beta includes everything that was originally intended to be in the final version (minus great UI). Allongside the package release, I also made a small showcase video about the current possibilities of the software (which you can watch [here](https://youtu.be/NWCe2zKY8Wo \"Wav2bar Showcase video\") if you haven't).\n\nIn this first beta, you will probably notice the user interface could really use some improvements, and that's normal. I firstly focused on having something that works, before diving too much in the UI (before working well, it has to work!). It will be improved throughout the next betas gradually. You probably also noticed that the video export can be very slow. I am aware of this problem, and while I have some ideas to try reducing it a tiny bit, it probably will stay like that for a while if not forever.\n\n## Answer to some feedback I received\n\nI didn't expect much feedback on the first release, especially as it has not been widely shared (a few social media posts and some shared links on Discord). A lot of commercial tools, online generators from templates and tutorials for these exists on the Internet, which makes it very difficult to be viewed anyway.\n\nFirstly I would like to give many thanks to the few people that tried it and provided direct feedback as well as some kind words about the project. It is very fullfilling to know it is helpful to some people! I also want to thanks those who stared the project on GitHub, that's not something I expected and it's also very motivating to see people interested in the project.\n\nNow, I also got some suggestions that I would like to share and talk about. Someone on GitHub suggested a Linux CLI for the tool. While this is just a too big task to handle for a solo driven project, I like the idea to be able to launch an export from the command line given a created project. That's not something I would implement anytime soon, but I put it in my todo list as a suggestion for a future update.\n\nSomeone by mail also suggested 2 things more graphical related. Firstly, he mentionned that the preview and the actual video could sometimes have differences in terms of rendering. While the objects are rendered the exact same way, the speed of the visualisation or the behavior of the particles can show some differences between the two. This is something that I am aware of, but that can't be fixed, due to how this is processed behind the scenes. The export performs a *\"delayed\"* rendering that renders each frame independently with strict respect of time. The preview however is performed by another API and is real time computation of the audio data. That means that if the FPS drop, the preview will inevitably be impacted because some frames are skipped, but the smoothing processes always base itself on the previous frame. I do not consider it an issue because, as the term preview imply, the goal is to give a precise enough idea of how the rendering will look, rather than live rendering how it will exactly look at export.

I think now is a good opportunity to let you know how things are going, as well as giving plans for the next month. Let's get started!\n\n## On going and planned updates\n\n### Wav2Bar 0.3.0 development\n\nWav2Bar 0.3.0 development Started in early August. This update is mostly a technical update, and thus for many reasons.\n\nIn the current implementation, each object has its own independent setup. That means that every time a change has to be made, it has to be repeated for every objects, which is very time consuming. Right now there are six available objects, so common changes and bug fixes have to be made six times. Let's be honest, this is absolutely not sustainable on the long term. That's why some heavy refactoring is being made in the background since August.\n\nThat said refactoring has been almost finished this week. So I would say add that one third of the update has been completed. I know this is taking a lot of times, but this is necessary to be able to implement new visualizers. So what else has to be made?\n\n### Roadmap\n\nHere is a roadmap of the future updates and planned features. This roadmap is absolutely not set in stone, and is subject to changes if needed as the times goes. But this should give you a good picture of what direction development is taking.\n\n- **0.3.0**\n    - **Write converter to new save format.** With the heavy refactoring, the inner structure of saves has changed quite a lot. So there is some work to do so support older saves.\n    - **Fix 0.2.2 issue where opening a new project doesn't clean up old objects' interface.**\n    - **Hide/show object feature.** This quality of life feature would help focusing on specific objects during design. I don't know yet if this will be saved or not.\n    - **Some layout fixes.** Updating the framework used to make Wav2Bar, Electron, introduced some quirks in the UI. It is also the opportunity to fix very small issues like the fact that the top audio controls take a lot of space. That make the screen less easily visible completely.\n    - **Display object borders on hovering of its settings.** It is not always easy to see the boundaries of an object (like particle flow objects), which doesn't help setting its size. This feature aim to fix this.\n- **0.3.1**\n    - **convert CLI command.** This quick command would convert the save to a newer said version. I also consider a potential folder support to make migrations easier if you like to keep up to date saves.\n    - **Keep track of last used folder in file explorer.** Because always starting from home folder and doing all the clicks again is annoying!\n- **0.4.0**\n    - **Continue internal refactoring, but less.** Some last changes have to be made in objects property handling so the rest listed below is easier to do.\n    - **New visualizers.** Yes. Finally. Two would be a great goal to start with. I need to experiment stuff.\n    - **Extend existing objects customization.** That includes more options for text and particle flows.\n- **0.4.1**\n    - **favorite folders in file explorer.** This can act as shortcuts.\n- **Box of ideas for the future (i.e possible but not confirmed)**\n    - full CLI with dedicated terminal and script reading\n    - more particle options\n    - gradient UI\n    - custom color picker\n    - more visualizers\n    - better linux support (once I find the good moment to setup a Linux dev environment)\n    - keyboard shortcuts\n    - mouse interactions to manipulate objects\n    - translations\n    - helper to make cool designs by picking between choices.\n    - factory templates\n    - More accurate preview (time based instead of frame based)\n\n## Cool, when does it come ?\n\nAs always, because I am the only maintainer and developer of Wav2Bar, and as this is done on my free time, this depends of multiple factors. That includes workload given by the university, my physical health (wrists specifically if you are familiar with RSI), and the rest of life. I am doing my best to push this project forward and satisfy requests, but I also need to find balance with life, that goes without saying.\n\n## Contribution\n\nI will be preparing a CONTRIBUTING.md file on GitHub soon primarily for documentation on the project, but also to get something if someone would ever be interested to contribute. If it is your case, please contact me at picorims.contact@gmail.com so we can discuss the topic (in the current state it is not ready for that, in terms of git branches).\n\nThat's it for today's devlog, stay tuned!\n\n~ Picorims","source":"_posts/devlog-september-2021.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Devlog - September 2021\ncategories:\n- news\n- devlogs\ndate: 2021-09-25 23:21:51\nupdated: 2021-09-25 23:44:26\ntags:\n- news\n- beta\n- devlog\nthumbnail: thumbnail-devlog-september-2021.png\n---\n\nHi!\n\nI have been quite silent since Wav2Bar 0.2.0 release on July.

I will also discuss some\nother topics regarding the near future of Wav2Bar.\n\n## So, where's 0.3.0?\n\nI was initially planning to release Wav2Bar 0.3.0 two weeks ago. It turns out university required my full attention since December. But things calmed down again, and everything I wanted to integrate into 0.3.0 is done. My goal right now is to release it by the next Sunday, hopefully with a Linux .zip file this time. As for .deb and .rpm, I still have issues making them, so I will probably take a look at other supported formats such as flatpak.\n\nI will make a dedicated post for the 0.3.0 update, but I can give you a quick grasp of what's new. First, some bugs from the latest release, such as video export from the command line or UI issues when switching projects have been patched in this version. Some outdated help have also been updated. Otherwise, since it is mostly a techinal update, it is mostly a bunch of small improvements here and there. Overall, I have made small improvements to the user interface layout and responsivity, in particular concerning the audio control part. The particle rendering is now updated when you tweak some settings, even when the audio is paused (for most of the visual options). A random color is picked for objects at creation so they are visible when on top of other objects (especially white objects). You can now also access logs from the settings (useful for bug reporting). Finally, the user interface is now locked behind a loading animation when the software is busy in background and shouldn't be touched.\n\nOn the development side, I made some technical improvements to the development environment, such as adding ESLint and starting to integrate unit tests (I finally found how to integrate unit testing to Electron, after two years!). What it basically mean is more protection against bugs for future releases, as the number of tests grows.\n\n## Updating the license from MIT to GPL\n\n**TL;DR: This change will allow to integrate FFmpeg instead of installing it manually, and it forces reuse of Wav2Bar source code to remain open source.**\n\nFrom day one, Wav2Bar has been licensed under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT \"MIT License\"), which is a permissive license. MIT allows pretty much anything as long as the copyright notice is kept.\n\nHowever I encountered an issue when I wanted to integrate FFmpeg to Wav2Bar for installation convenience. FFmpeg is either licensed under [LGPL-2.1](https://opensource.org/licenses/LGPL-2.1 \"GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1\") or later, or [GPL-2.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-2.0 \"GNU General Public License version 2\") or later license depending of integrated libraries. To make things simple, GPL is a license encouraging free software, that require any derivative work to also be licensed under GPL. LGPL is a variant which is a bit less restrictive on that, but works more or less the same way. In other words, if I want to directly provide FFmpeg into Wav2Bar packages, I need to comply by the GPL, and license the whole software as GPL. The reason is that Wav2Bar uses libx264 to encode .mp4 videos, and this library is licensed under GPL, so the LGPL can't be used (alternatives like openh264 exists but aren't as performant).\n\nThat is why Wav2Bar will soon be licensed under GPL-3.0 or later. Older versions will remain licensed under MIT, as they have been distributed under MIT, this only affect future releases. The GPL license is a very controversial topic, considering its ability to spread everywhere. However I consider it the best choice right now for the user interest (conveniency for FFmpeg of course, but more broadly user rights). I considered the option to dual license Wav2Bar under both MIT and GPL, with the MIT version not receiving FFmpeg, but this is more trouble that I don't want to handle, considering the limited time I can offer for Wav2Bar development.\n\nThis won't affect your use of Wav2Bar is any way, and the project remain free and open-source as it always has been.\n\n## Future releases: give your feedback!\n\n**I have created a form [here](https://framaforms.org/wav2bar-feedback-16012022-1642357540 \"Give feedback on Wav2Bar\") (full link: https://framaforms.org/wav2bar-feedback-16012022-1642357540) to get feedback about the usability of Wav2Bar and most wanted features. If you have five minutes, I would really appreciate some user input! No personal information is required.**\n\n## GitHub\n\nI may do some changes about how things are organized on GitHub, like launch a GitHub Projects to track progress (I have my own local board, this would be for you, users, to see development progress), or use branches.\n\n## That's it!\n\nThanks for reading! I hope you enjoyed this devlog, and I'll keep you updated when Wav2Bar 0.3.0 is out.

The particle rendering is now updated when you tweak some settings, even when the audio is paused (for most of the visual options). A random color is picked for objects at creation so they are visible when on top of other objects (especially white objects).

To make things simple, GPL is a license encouraging free software, that require any derivative work to also be licensed under GPL. LGPL is a variant which is a bit less restrictive on that, but works more or less the same way. In other words, if I want to directly provide FFmpeg into Wav2Bar packages, I need to comply by the GPL, and license the whole software as GPL. The reason is that Wav2Bar uses libx264 to encode .mp4 videos, and this library is licensed under GPL, so the LGPL can't be used (alternatives like openh264 exists but aren't as performant).\n\nThat is why Wav2Bar will soon be licensed under GPL-3.0 or later.

The GPL license is a very controversial topic, considering its ability to spread everywhere. However I consider it the best choice right now for the user interest (conveniency for FFmpeg of course, but more broadly user rights). I considered the option to dual license Wav2Bar under both MIT and GPL, with the MIT version not receiving FFmpeg, but this is more trouble that I don't want to handle, considering the limited time I can offer for Wav2Bar development.\n\nThis won't affect your use of Wav2Bar is any way, and the project remain free and open-source as it always has been.\n\n## Future releases: give your feedback!\n\n**I have created a form [here](https://framaforms.org/wav2bar-feedback-16012022-1642357540 \"Give feedback on Wav2Bar\") (full link: https://framaforms.org/wav2bar-feedback-16012022-1642357540) to get feedback about the usability of Wav2Bar and most wanted features.
