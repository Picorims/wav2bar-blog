Hi!

I make this quick post to let you know that I have to put aside Wav2Bar development from February to April. I may still do small bits of work here and there (preparing Wav2Bar 0.3.1), but right now University requires my full attention. I have quite a lot of work to handle, but also have to prepare the coming months for my personal career, which eats up a good chunk of my free time. Because I am a human and not a robot, my body has limits as well, and I need to rest in the tiny space left each week.

I know that development is very slow, and I know even more how some people are impatient about coming features (like synchronized lyrics which has been requested to me by a user). I am doing my best to keep this project active, while not compromising my physical and mental health.

Thank you all for your patience, and if you would like to be more frequently updated, feel free to join the Discord server(invite link to the bottom of this page, on GitHub as well as the main website) and drop a little message; or send me an email (same places).

Have a nice week, and by the way, happy Lunar New Year to those celebrating it!
